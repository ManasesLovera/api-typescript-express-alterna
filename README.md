# API using typescript and express

## Guide

This is a project to practice how to create APIs and use the methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

For this project I used:
    ```express```

And for development I used:
    ```typescript```
    ```@types/express```

To start this project you must do first:
    ```npm i``` or ```npm install```
to install all dependencies.

If you want to add some code to this project I recommend using:
    ```npm run start:dev```
This will compile the typescript code to javascript and execute it, and everytime you save your code
you don't need to recompile again.

You can also use:
    ```npm run build```
to compile to javascript

And then:
    ```npm start```
to run the javascript code.
